This is a project which connects an android app with a mcu placed inside a helmet. The user marks the start and the end pins in a map like interface in the app, then it tries to connect to the mcu via bluetooth. While traveling if the user has to take a right turn the right led glows, if the user has to take a left turn the left led glows. This will continue until the user has taken the turn.
